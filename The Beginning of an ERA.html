                    Today, the beginning of an era is being written by yours</br>
                    truly, not only is it being written but thought of
                    at the same</br>time.</br>
                </p>
            <h2>Continue Cee J</br>31_Jul</h2>
                <p>
                    Even though "Mr. Gipson" is scripting the beginning of an</br>
                    era, it is imperrative to note that in this ground breaking</br>
                    process of scripting the universe, that he is not alone.</br>
                    Though i am merely observe, i am part of the process...
                </p>
            <h2>Continues, Mr. Gipson</br>31_Jul</h2>
                <p>
                    Nevertheless, with only one spectator in the universe that is<br>
                    being or is to be and the Writter/Creator/Scriptor of</br>
                    such a universe by his side. The job/activity merely bacame</br>
                    void of it's entertainent. Thus, the create of Stars for colour.</br>
                    Gipson himself was impressed with the though of very shinny balls</br>
                    that can explode at any given time</br>holding the fabric of everything
                    in its cosmos.</br>
